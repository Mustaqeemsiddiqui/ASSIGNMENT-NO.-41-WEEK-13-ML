    "### Step 5: Interpret the Result\n",

    "\n",
    "The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient \\( \\rho_s \\) is approximately -0.1714, indicating a very weak negative correlation between age and preference for a particular brand of soft drink. This suggests that there is little to no monotonic relationship between the two variables in this sample."

    "**ANSWER:------**\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the number of sales calls made per day and the number of sales made per week based on data from a sample of 30 sales representatives, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Collect Data\n",
    "Assume you have collected the following data:\n",
    "- Number of sales calls made per day (X): \\( X = \\{x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_{30}\\} \\)\n",
    "- Number of sales made per week (Y): \\( Y = \\{y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_{30}\\} \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Compute Means\n",
    "Calculate the means of \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\):\n",
    "\\[ \\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{30} \\sum_{i=1}^{30} x_i \\]\n",
    "\\[ \\bar{y} = \\frac{1}{30} \\sum_{i=1}^{30} y_i \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Compute Standard Deviations\n",
    "Compute the standard deviations of \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\):\n",
    "\\[ s_x = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{29} \\sum_{i=1}^{30} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2} \\]\n",
    "\\[ s_y = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{29} \\sum_{i=1}^{30} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Compute Covariance\n",
    "Calculate the covariance between \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\):\n",
    "\\[ \\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \\frac{1}{30} \\sum_{i=1}^{30} (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y}) \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Compute the Pearson Correlation Coefficient \\( r \\)\n",
    "Now, use the formula for Pearson correlation coefficient \\( r \\):\n",
    "\\[ r = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{s_x \\cdot s_y} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Perform the Calculation\n",
    "Substitute the values calculated in steps 2, 3, and 4 into the formula for \\( r \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Calculation (Hypothetical Data)\n",
    "Let's assume we have the following hypothetical data for 5 sales representatives for simplicity:\n",
    "- Number of sales calls per day \\( X = \\{10, 15, 20, 25, 30\\} \\)\n",
    "- Number of sales per week \\( Y = \\{3, 5, 7, 9, 11\\} \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculate Means\n",
    "\\[ \\bar{x} = \\frac{10 + 15 + 20 + 25 + 30}{5} = 20 \\]\n",
    "\\[ \\bar{y} = \\frac{3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11}{5} = 7 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculate Standard Deviations\n",
    "\\[ s_x = \\sqrt{\\frac{(10-20)^2 + (15-20)^2 + (20-20)^2 + (25-20)^2 + (30-20)^2}{5-1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100 + 25 + 0 + 25 + 100}{4}} = \\sqrt{62.5} \\approx 7.91 \\]\n",
    "\\[ s_y = \\sqrt{\\frac{(3-7)^2 + (5-7)^2 + (7-7)^2 + (9-7)^2 + (11-7)^2}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{16 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 16}{4}} = \\sqrt{10} \\approx 3.16 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculate Covariance\n",
    "\\[ \\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \\frac{(10-20)(3-7) + (15-20)(5-7) + (20-20)(7-7) + (25-20)(9-7) + (30-20)(11-7)}{5} \\]\n",
    "\\[ \\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \\frac{(-10 \\cdot -4) + (-5 \\cdot -2) + (0 \\cdot 0) + (5 \\cdot 2) + (10 \\cdot 4)}{5} \\]\n",
    "\\[ \\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \\frac{40 + 10 + 0 + 10 + 40}{5} = \\frac{100}{5} = 20 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculate Pearson Correlation Coefficient \\( r \\)\n",
    "\\[ r = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{s_x \\cdot s_y} = \\frac{20}{7.91 \\cdot 3.16} \\approx \\frac{20}{25} = 0.8 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation of \\( r \\)\n",
    "The Pearson correlation coefficient \\( r = 0.8 \\) indicates a strong positive linear relationship between the number of sales calls made per day and the number of sales made per week. This suggests that as the number of sales calls increases, the number of sales also tends to increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "By calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient \\( r \\) for the given data, we can quantitatively assess the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the number of sales calls made per day and the number of sales made per week among the sample of 30 sales representatives."
